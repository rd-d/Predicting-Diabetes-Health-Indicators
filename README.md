# Predicting-Diabetes-Health-Indicators

To predict diabetes health markers, ML algorithms were applied to a dataset of 253,680 survey responses. Using logistic regression, random forest, and ANN models, we achieved 85% accuracy. For improved evaluation and insights, we used feature selection, K-fold cross-validation, and data visualization. Expertise in data preparation, feature selection, and predictive modeling for diabetes health indicators is required.
